I am currently a Master’s student in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at*Université Paris-Saclay.  
My academic background has given me strong foundations in statistical modeling, probability, and machine learning, with coursework and labs in supervised & unsupervised learning, optimization, databases, and deep learning.   

I am now looking for a 5-month research internship from end of March 2026 to end of August 2026 in the Paris area.  

Beyond academics, I also have experience in **math tutoring** and collaborative projects (e.g. proofreading and typesetting mathematical material in LaTeX), which taught me rigor, clarity, and teamwork.
